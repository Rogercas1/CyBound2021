# Bivariate data

Suppose you have a collection of x-y points, e.g. 

```{r}
set.seed(20210701)
n <- 9
d <- data.frame(x = round(runif(n, 0, 100))) %>%
  mutate(y = round(x + rnorm(n, 0, 2)))
d
```

These points are defined by $(x_i,y_i)$ for $i=1,\ldots,N=9$. 
For example, for observation 1, we have $(`r d$x[1]`, `r d$y[1]`)$.

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point()
```



## Residuals

For a proposed line $y=Mx+b$, the residual for observation $i$ is defined as 
$$r_i = y_i - (Mx_i + b).$$

One approach to finding a line is to find the values for $M$ and $b$ that 
minimize the following function
$$f(M,b) = \sum_{i=1}^N |y_i - (Mx_i + b)|.$$
