# Things to think about

## Code

The ui function (user interface) features a check box input and (conditionally on the check box being checked) a slider input.  What other inputs are possible?

The server function handles output.  A renderPlot function is used to plot the data and the fitted curve.  A renderText function is used to output text to the screen associated with the predicted value.  What other outputs are possible?

## Line/Curve - Fitting

How is the "data" generated?
