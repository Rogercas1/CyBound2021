# CyBound2021

This is a repository for content related to Roger Castillo Ramos's CyBound 
research in the summer of 2021. 
The goal for this research is to build an R shiny app to allow farmer's to 
understand how their yield and nitrous oxide emissions are affected by 
fertilizer application. 

The three main directories are 

- docs/ 
- data/ 
- code/
