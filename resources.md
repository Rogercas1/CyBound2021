# Resources

This page will contain a one-stop shop for all the resources we come up with to
help support the Carbon Markets summer research project. 

## R resources

We plan to develop a shiny app and therefore an understanding of R will be 
helpful. 
I have a page with some resources to [help get students up and running with 
R/RStudio as well as Git/GitHub](https://www.jarad.me/teaching/2017/08/31/getting-started-with-R-and-Git-GitHub.html). 


### swirl

[swirl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/swirl/index.html) is an R 
package to help you learn R interactively. To install swirl, open R and, 
in the console, type 

    install.packages("swirl")
    
Then, in any R session where you want to use swirl type

    library(swirl)
    swirl()

## Carbon markets

### ISU Carbon Removal Forum

In March, ISU held an "ISU Carbon Removal Forum" and the three recorded sessions
are 

- [Part 1](https://youtu.be/VPfZwfUYCog)
- [Part 2](https://youtu.be/IJWoe598yU0)
- [Part 3](https://youtu.be/_w6PskAx6oI)

### Conversations about Carbon

Following that forum, a biweekly series called 
[Conversations about Carbon](https://www.biorenew.iastate.edu/conversations-about-carbon/) 
was initiated. 
I've been told to focus on the conversations with 
[Jill Euken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYiFQp7cH9o&ab_channel=Rolebiorenew) 
and 
[Chad Hart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onuV2ZkUlyk&ab_channel=Rolebiorenew). 

### Illinois Sustainable Ag Partnership

I was also suggested the [Illinois Sustainable Ag Partnership](https://ilsustainableag.org/)
as a good resource for carbon markets and the role of agriculture in the process.
